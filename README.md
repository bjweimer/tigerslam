TigerSLAM source code.

## Installing

This project has been setup to use [gb](https://getgb.io/), a build tool for
Go projects. When you have installed [gb](https://getgb.io/), and
[Go](https://golang.org/), you simply have to navigate to the project and type
in your command line:

```bash
gb build robot
```
BJW is updating the initial repo code to match code currently in development but also
successfully running on his robot at this point...
